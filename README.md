##  Project Overview

This project leverages the [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. Using machine learning algorithms like **KNN**, **NaÃ¯ve Bayes**, **Decision Trees**, and more, the project demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, and performance evaluation.

##  Features

1. **Data Processing:**
   - Cleaning missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables and normalizing features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing distributions and feature relationships.
   - Identifying important predictors.

3. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implementation of multiple algorithms:
     - KNN
     - NaÃ¯ve Bayes
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
     - Logistic Regression
   - Model evaluation using metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

4. **Visualization:**
   - Confusion matrix and ROC curves for model comparison.
